# Open questions

What [the spec](SPEC.md) states that hasn't been confirmed by a capture of Apple devices, or leaves undefined because nobody knows yet. Settle them with captures (`tests/captures/`) before building on them, then update the spec and drop the item here.

1. How phone numbers and email addresses are normalized before hashing (BLE-4).
2. What byte 0 (`0x40`) and the 3-byte tag of a version 3 BLE advertisement mean, and whether version 1 still wakes current iPhones (BLE-2, BLE-5).
3. The HTTP status of a `401` `/Discover` response (DISC-2).
4. Which flag bit is pipelined upload. Analysis of `sharingd` names a SupportsUPP bit "0xb", and gives `0x3FB` as an example of it, which has neither `0x004` nor `0x800` set (MDNS-4).
5. Whether macOS receivers time out an unanswered `/Ask`, and what they send then. iOS has no timeout of its own, and answers a decline with `401` (ASK-2).
6. `TransferVersion`'s type and values, and what they unlock. It's said to gate DVZip and pipelined upload (§6.3).
7. The validation record's key names, and whether it binds to the account the sender's TLS client certificate names (ID-2, TLS-3).
8. What `/SharedIdentity` and `/Error` do, and whether a receiver must serve them for current senders (HTTP-4).
9. The other keys, about 24, that Apple receivers publish in TXT, and whether any matter to Apple senders (MDNS-1).
10. Whether an identity extracted from the user's own Mac gets accepted without a prompt on their iPhone (ASK-6).
11. The layouts of the Service Response (2), Sync Tree (20) and Bloom Filter (22) TLVs (AWDL-6). The Service Response TLV would let a receiver skip the bursts of MDNS-7, and may be why an iPhone's mDNS doesn't reach a Linux node (DISC-5).
12. *Settled* (§6.4).
13. What `SenderIdentityAuthTag` is, and whether Contacts Only receivers need it. It changes with each transfer, and isn't the BLE advertisement's tag (§6.4).
14. What `IDSSessionID` and `ReceiverPseudonym` in the `/Discover` response, and `SenderPseudonym` and `SenderPushToken` in `/Upload`, are for (§6.3, §6.5).
15. Whether macOS receivers require the current `/Ask` form too (ASK-7).
16. Whether Apple peers need the ICMPv6 echo of OWLY-2 to learn a node's neighbor entry, or something else Owly does already teaches them.
